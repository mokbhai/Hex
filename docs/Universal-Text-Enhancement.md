Universal Text Enhancement

  Core Workflow:
  1. Enhancement Hotkey: User-configurable hotkey in Hex settings
  2. Universal Enhancement: ANY selected text → enhanced version replaces it
  3. Visual Feedback: Text highlights during 2-5 second processing
  4. Smart Placement: Replace if editable field, copy to clipboard if not
  5. System Undo: Cmd+Z works natively, no custom undo needed

  The Beauty of This Simplicity:
  - One hotkey to rule them all
  - No context detection complexity
  - Works everywhere - system-wide utility
  - User controls their own hotkey preference
  - Leverages system undo behavior

  Success Criteria

  Measurable Outcomes:
  - Daily editing time: 20-30 minutes → 2-5 minutes (90% reduction)
  - Universal coverage: Works in ANY app with selectable text
  - Zero learning curve: Same enhancement for everything
  - Configurable to avoid hotkey conflicts

  User Value:
  - Save 1.5+ hours daily across ALL text work
  - One hotkey muscle memory for everything
  - No more app-specific enhancement tools
  - Professional communication quality everywhere

  Complexity Assessment

  Overall Complexity: Medium (Simplified from original)

  Key Components:
  - Local AI model for enhancement
  - System-wide text selection detection
  - Customizable hotkey system
  - Editable field detection logic
  - Visual processing feedback

  Constraints & Assumptions:
  - User has accessibility permissions for system-wide text detection
  - Local AI model quality meets enhancement needs
  - 2-5 second processing time is acceptable
  - macOS accessibility APIs support text field detection
