## Tips for Effective Voice Commands

### Command Structure

**Natural Phrasing:**

- Commands work best when spoken naturally
- Avoid stilted or robotic speech patterns
- Complete your thought before stopping

**Example Variations:**

```
"Open Safari" ✓
"Can you open Safari?" ✓
"Please open Safari" ✓
"Open the Safari browser" ✓
"Safari" (often works) ✓
```

### Ambiguity Resolution

If your command is ambiguous, Hex asks for clarification:

```
You: "Set a timer"
Hex: "How long should the timer be?"
You: "Five minutes"
```

### Chaining Commands

Group related commands:

```
"Open Safari and search for machine learning"
```

### Context Awareness

Hex remembers context:

```
You: "Open Excel"
[Excel opens]
You: "Maximize it" (refers to Excel window)
```

## Error Recovery

If Hex doesn't understand:

1. **Rephrase**: Try different wording
2. **Be Specific**: Add more context
3. **Slow Down**: Speak at normal pace, clearly
4. **Check Audio**: Verify microphone is working
5. **Ask for Help**: "What commands can you do?"

## Advanced Usage

### Command Shortcuts

Frequently repeated commands can be shortened:

```
"5-minute timer" → Creates 5-minute timer
"Search AI news" → Searches for AI news
"Note: meeting notes" → Creates note
```

### Contextual Inference

Hex understands context from recent activity:

```
(After opening Safari)
You: "Search for Python"
Hex: (Opens search results in Safari)

(While in Mail)
You: "New message"
Hex: (Creates new email draft)
```

### Custom Voice Patterns

Over time, Hex learns your speech patterns and command preferences, improving recognition accuracy.

## Troubleshooting Commands

### If Recognition Fails

```
Command: "Search for pizza"
Response: [Silence or no results]

Solution:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify microphone input in settings
3. Rephrase as "Find pizza restaurants near me"
```

### If Action Doesn't Execute

```
Command: "Open Gmail"
Response: (No action)

Possible Issues:
1. Gmail might not be a standalone app
2. Try "Open Safari and go to Gmail"
3. Check if email app is installed
```
